# rust-new-project-template
a basic word count tool that takes in text from standard input, counts the frequency of each word, and outputs the `n` most common words. The words and their counts are stored in a `Vocabulary` struct, which uses a `HashMap` to keep track of the word counts and a `Vec` to store the sorted list of word counts.

## Getting Started
### Navigate to the project directory

```
cd wordcount
```
### Run the program
```
cargo run
```
